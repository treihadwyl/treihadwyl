 * (this allows that class to extend whatever it likes),
 * although all other argument must return a function that extends the its
 * argument to return a new class that inherits from the argument.
 * This function then composes those modules together by chaining one class
 * into the last, hence, order is important and the first class can inherit
 * nothing or whatever it likes whereas subsequent classes must inherit the
 * previous class in the list.
