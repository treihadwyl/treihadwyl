Treihadwyl is an old school dungeon crawler with a few multiplayer aspects thrown in for good measure, it *is* playable in a browser after all!

## Getting Started

## Contributing

At this stage all the code is open (and will probably remain so) but Iâ€™m not currently accepting pull requests. Bug reports, feature requests or any other feedback are encouraged so please feel free to open an issue.

All code is organised into packages, each package is a standalone with its own test suite and development cycle.
